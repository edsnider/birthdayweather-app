# BirthdayWeather demo Xamarin app
This is one of the demo apps I built and used in my CodeMash 2019 Xamarin talk. 

## Pre-requisites
The weather data used in this app comes from the Dark Sky API. If you want to use this code you will need a [Dark Sky API key](https://darksky.net/dev). Once you have your key be sure to add it to the `DarkSkyWeatherService` class on [line 15](https://github.com/edsnider/birthdayweather-app/blob/master/BirthdayWeather/BirthdayWeather/Services/DarkSkyWeatherService.cs#L15).
